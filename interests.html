          <h2 id="about">ABOUT</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Emily Koceja and I am an aspiring Web Developer. I come
            from a teaching background. I have experience being a PLC
            <em>(Professional Learning Community)</em> Leader in Education. I
            taught sixth grade English Language Arts for 4 years and also worked
            as a Dual-Language Teacher for fourth graders. The biggest lesson I
            learned is that being a team player is vital in being a leader.
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided to venture out into the tech industry for the consistent
            opportunities to grow professionally. Before starting the Stiegler
            Ed Tech Program, I took some courses on Udemy to ensure the industry
            aligned with my goals and interests. The two courses I took are
            <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/"
              >The Web Development Bootcamp</a
            >
            and
            <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/"
              >50 Projects in 50 Days</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although it is still early on in my career path, I am excited to
            continue to learn and grow as a developer.

          <p>
            I work hard on a daily basis to become part of the tech industry.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Web Development</h4>
          <p>
            According to
            <a
              href="https://brainstation.io/career-guides/what-is-web-development"
              >Brainstation</a
            >, web development is the tasks associated with creating, building,
            and maintaining websites and applications that run on a browser.
            There is a scope of different things under the web development
            pathway. The three main types of web development are front-end,
            back-end and full-stack. At the moment I am most interested in
            front-end development, but I am working on becoming more well
            rounded and valuable to the industry as a full-stack developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am interested in this career pathway and have been for a while.
            Prior to this opportunity I was taking a web development bootcamp
            class on Udemy and have found the basics fun. It has been
            challenging, but it keeps me mentally stimulated. With further
            research I also learned that employment for developers will increase
            about 30.3% between 2021-2031, which allows for more opportunities.
          </p>
          <h4>UI/UX Design</h4>
          <p>
            UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) Designers work together
            to create a product. UI designers tend more to the aesthetics of of
            a digital product. They create the look and feel of a website,
            making it functional, easy to use, and visually appealing- according
            to
            <a href="https://flatironschool.com/blog/what-is-ux-ui-design/"
              >flatironschool</a
            >. UX designers plan the experience a person has when interacting
            with said product. They focus on the interaction with users have
            with everyday products and services. They also do a lot of research
            to make a product easy to use by conducting interviews, testing
            behaviors, check the flow of the product and test and continue to
            improve the product over time. Both of these jobs require attention
            to detail and soft skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            This field falls hand in hand with web developers, which is why it
            is why it is something I am interested in. I requires similar skills
            that can be applied that I know I can master and transfer.
          </p>
          <h4>Scrum Master</h4>
          <p>
            A scrum mater is a coach and guide for their team and understands
            the scrum framework, principles, and values. They support continuous
            team improvement as their duties are facilitating conversations,
            managing impediments and coaching the team. These soft skills are
            similar to those of being a teacher. Their responsibilities are to
            make sure the team understand the use of scrum effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am interested in this agile path, as it reminds me of my teaching
            experience. Some of the qualities of this position include: natural
            focus on the team, enjoying helping people grow, people oriented,
            facilitating discussions, empowering teams and ensuring that the
            team understand the priorities.

          <h4>Hiking</h4>
          <p>
            I previously lived in the Raligh/Durham area and it offered for so
            many historical trails. On of my favorite places to go is the
            Unstead Trails. The location consists of smaller trails of different
            lengths. Having the option for various lengths and difficulty levels
            offers an opportunity to hike daily. Another favorite is in the NC
            Botanical Garden in Chapel Hill. This trail is also made up of
            several trails, each with different strenuous levels. I am currently
            seeking trails in the Charlotte area to visit. Now that the weather
            is getting warmer, I can't wait to spend more time outside!
          </p>
          <h4>Reading</h4>
          <p>
            Recently I have started to be a more avid reader. Currently, my
            favorite author is Colleen Hoover. She writes more rom-com books
            with some mystery; which is what I enjoy the most. I have also
            ventured out to seek and read books written from Latinx authors. I
            feel more soon and identified in those books. Some that resonate
            with me are <cite>I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter</cite> by
            Erica Sanchez, <cite>Big Chicas Don't Cry</cite> by Annette Chavez
            Macias, and <cite>Mexican Gothic</cite> by Silvia Moreno-Garcia.
          </p>
          <h4>Arts</h4>
          <p>
            I am always trying new things to push my limitations. I started when
            I was young. One Christmas all I wanted was a sewing machine,
            because I wanted to make my own clothes. Luckily my dad was very
            supportive and worked hard to help me achieve that goal. I did that
            for a while and through the years I have picked up different hobbies
            surrounding the arts that have turned into skills. I have always had
            a passiong for learning. So, when the globe shut down due to the
            pandemic, I picked up new hobbies. Now I know how to tend to most
            indoor plants, crochet, knit, and even make polymer clay jewelry. I
            am constantly seeking new arts to dive into!
